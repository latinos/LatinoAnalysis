### This file specifies how the merging of salples and/or categories should be performed.
### It may contain one or both the lists "categories_to_merge" and "processes to merge".
### Each one is a list of dicts as in the examples below. "new_name" is the name that
### will be given to the merged procs/cats. "old_names" is a list of procs/cats to be
### merged toghether. 

### Optionally, any process you add to processes_to_remove will not show up in the
### table.

### Note that in any case names have to exactly correspond to the ones found in the
### input workspace.
